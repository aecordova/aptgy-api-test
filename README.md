## Description of the project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge and proficiency on Ruby on Rails framework by building a sample API app where authenticated USERS can ORDER GIFTS on behalf of a SCHOOL to designated RECIPIENTS. Orders can have multiple recipients and gifts at the same time, with a limit of 20 distinct recipients per order and 60 gifts per day.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Built with
* Ruby on Rails 6
* Postgres

### Dev Environment Requirements:
* Ruby needs to be installed to run the code, check [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for further steps
* Postgres DB needs to be setup locally to run the code, check docs [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) for further guidance


### ‚≠êÔ∏è Running the code
#### Instructions for running on local environment:

1. Clone the repo

2. Navigate to the root directory

3. Run bundle install to ensure all the needed gems are installed:
    ```
    $ bundle install
    ```
3. Run Yarn Install
    ```
    $ yarn install --check-files
    ```
3. Migrate the DB
    ```
    $ rails db:migrate
    ```
3. Run Rails Server
    ```
    $ rails server
    ```
3. Create a User, send a request with at least email, password and password_confirmation fields in the body
    ```
    url:    https://localhost:3000/auth/

    header: Content-Type: application/json
    body:
            {
               "email": "test@email.com",
               "password": "password",
              "password_confirmation": "password"
            }
    ```
3. You will receive an :ok response with your credentials and token. Please send it in the headers for authentication in all future requests: you will need:
    ```
     - uid
     - access-token
     - client 
    ```

### ‚≠êÔ∏è How it works

These are the endpoints:

| Concerns/Constraints:  |   |
|---|---|
|Individual Orders are limited to a maximum of 20 Recipients|
|Schools are limited to send out a total of 60 gifts per day|
|There are four types of gift: MUG, T_SHIRT, HOODIE, STICKER.
|Orders have the following workflow status: ORDER_RECEIVED, ORDER_PROCESSING,ORDER_SHIPPED, ORDER_CANCELLED.|
|Orders can be sent to multiple Recipients and contain multiple gifts.|
|When an Order is marked to be ORDER_SHIPPED there's a flag on the order to determine whether to send the Recipient(s) an email message that their gift is on its way|
|All endpoints include an Auth Token in their requests|
